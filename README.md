 Car-Pooling-System
 🚗 Grab It – Car Pooling System (MVP)
Grab It is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a full-stack Python-based Car Pooling System developed using:
Frontend: React, Next.js
Backend: FastAPI
Database: Sqlite
Other Tools: (JWT auth, Tailwind, Axios, etc. — optional)
This project was built during a 100-hour Python Full Stack Development training organized by CIT and Revature, where I recently became a Certified Python Full-Stack Developer.

🎯 Project Overview
The goal of this MVP is to showcase a functional carpooling workflow, including:
User registration & login
Posting ride offers
Searching for availablerides
Booking / joining rides
Basic UI with responsive pages
API endpoints built using FastAPI
Simple and clean frontend interactions
While this is not a fully polished production application, it demonstrates the complete end-to-end flow of a carpooling system built from scratch.
